## Alkalinity

* Alkalinity significantly affects water quality by acting as a buffer, preventing rapid changes in pH levels, which is crucial for aquatic life and can also impact the taste and corrosiveness of drinking water depending on its level; high alkalinity can resist pH drops from acidic pollutants while low alkalinity makes a water body more susceptible to sudden pH changes


## Dissolved Aluminum

* Dissolved aluminum can negatively affect water quality, primarily by potentially causing aesthetic issues like a cloudy or discolored appearance at higher concentrations, and can also raise concerns regarding potential health impacts, particularly when levels exceed recommended standards, as aluminum can accumulate in the body and may be linked to certain health conditions, especially in vulnerable populations; however, the exact impact depends on factors like water pH and the overall concentration of aluminum present.
